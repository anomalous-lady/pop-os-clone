# Pop!_OS Clone — README

This project is a **frontend clone** of the Pop!_OS landing page. It was built as part of a task to demonstrate frontend development skills.

 🚀 What I Did
 1. **Structure (HTML)**
- Created a single-page application using only HTML, CSS, and vanilla JavaScript.
- Sections included:
  - **Header / Navbar** — sticky navigation bar with links and a CTA button.
  - **Hero Section** — headline, subtext, and a call-to-action area.
  - **Features Section** — three feature cards describing Pop!_OS features.
  - **Why Choose Pop!_OS** — two-card grid layout highlighting productivity and developer focus.
  - **Download Section** — two cards for Intel/AMD and NVIDIA downloads.
  - **Footer** — System76 branding and credits.

 2. **Styling (CSS)**
- Used **CSS variables** for colors (`--bg`, `--card`, `--muted`, `--accent`).
- Designed a **dark-themed layout** with gradients, glass effects, and rounded cards.
- Implemented a **responsive grid system** using CSS Grid & Flexbox.
- Added **animations** (`pulse` effect) to highlight the mock desktop screenshot.
- Ensured **mobile responsiveness**:
  - Navigation collapses into a hamburger menu.
  - Layout changes from 2-column to single column on small screens.

 3. **Interactivity (JavaScript)**
- Added a **mobile navigation toggle**:
  - When clicked, the hamburger menu shows/hides the nav links.
- Included **smooth scroll prevention** for empty links (`#`).

 4. **Design Choices**
- Mimicked Pop!_OS branding using **green accents** and dark UI.
- Used **Google Fonts (Inter)** for modern typography.
- Applied **card-based layout** to keep design modular and clean.

 🛠️ How to Run

1. Clone or download the repository.
2. Open `index.html` in any modern browser.
3. No build tools required — it’s plain HTML, CSS, and JS.

 📦 Deployment
- This site can be easily deployed to **GitHub Pages, Vercel, or Netlify**.
- Example: drag-and-drop the project folder to [Netlify](https://www.netlify.com/) for instant deployment.


 📌 Future Improvements
- Convert to **React / Next.js** for modularity.
- Add real **Pop!_OS assets** and screenshots.
- Implement **download modal** with simulated ISO download.
- Enhance **accessibility** with ARIA roles and better keyboard navigation.
